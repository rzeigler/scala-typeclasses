# Typeclasses in Scala

Ryan Zeigler

# What Is A Typeclass?

Term typeclass comes from Haskell

Ad-hoc polymorphism

A contract for a type just like an interface

--

Lets see an example

--

```tut:silent
final case class Rational(p: Int, q: Int) {
  def compareTo(o: Rational): Int = p * o.q - o.p * q
}

object Rational {
  implicit val rationalOrdering: Ordering[Rational] = new Ordering[Rational] {
    def compare(a: Rational, b: Rational): Int = a.p * b.q - b.p * a.q
  }
}
```

---

# Encoding in Scala

Typeclasses are traits

Methods on the trait general take arguments of the instance type

Instances for types are implicits

Requiring an instance means taking an implicit parameter

```scala
class List[A] {
  // ...
  def sorted(implicit ev: Ordering[A]): List[A]
  // ...
}
```

Given an `Ordering[A]` I can produce a sorted `List[A]`

---

# Why Would We Want This?

The simplest typeclass uses are easily encodable with interfaces

`Ordering[A]` is more or less the same as `implements Comparable[A]`

With the typeclass approach we can define operations that rely on typeclass at the point of consumption. 

Java has Collections which is a bag of static methods that handles sorting everything

???
IMO this is easier to think about

---

# Why Would We Want This - Interlude?

A Semigroup is something with an append/addition operation

Some common examples of semigroups:
  Int, Double, String, List

```tut:silent
trait Semigroup[A] {
  def append(a1: A, a2: A): A
}
```

A Monoid is a semigroup with the addition of an identity element.

Think `0` for Int, `""` for String

```tut:silent
trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] {
  def empty: A
}
```

---

# Why Would We Want This - Derivable Instances

```tut:silent
implicit val intMonoid: Monoid[Int] = new Monoid[Int] {
  def append(a1: Int, a2: Int): Int = a1 + a2
  def empty: Int = 0
}

implicit def optionMonoid[A: Semigroup]: Monoid[Option[A]] = 
  new Monoid[Option[A]] {
    def append(a1: Option[A], a2: Option[A]): Option[A] = 
      a1.flatMap(a => a2.map(b => implicitly[Semigroup[A]].append(a, b)))
        .orElse(a1)
        .orElse(a2)
    def empty: Option[A] = None
  }
```

---

# Why Would We Want This

--

* Automatic derivation; Instances based on typeclass instances of other types

--

* If we have a `Semigroup[A]` we automatically have a `Monoid[Option[A]]`

--

* This kind of dependent relationship is hard to express with interfaces 
  but is common with the decoupling provided by typeclasses

--

* `class Option[A] extends Monoid[Option[A]] when A <: Semigroup` ???

???

Semigroups but not monoids (NEL, NEV)...

---

# Why Would We Want This

* We can mix together typeclass constraints to build powerful abstractions

* Ever wanted to quickly sum the numbers in some collection


```tut:silent
def sum[A: Monoid](as: List[A]): A = 
  as.foldLeft(implicitly[Monoid[A]].empty)(implicitly[Monoid[A]].append)
```
```tut
sum(List(1, 2, 3))
```
--

* Oh, the requirements changed, now we have to some records that may or may not have numbers...

--

```tut
sum(List(Some(1), Some(2), None, Some(3)))
```

---

# Typeclass Providers

* There are several projects/ecosystems that provide typeclasses
--
* [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) - the original; monolithic; in development version 8 is experimenting with a new encoding
--
* [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) - newer; ecosystem of projects roughly equivalent to scalaz
--
* [spire](https://github.com/typelevel/spire) - also typelevel; types and typeclasses for numeric operations
--
* All of these provide Semigroup and Monoid before you roll your own
