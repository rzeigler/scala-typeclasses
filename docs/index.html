# Typeclasses in Scala

Ryan Zeigler


---

# What Is A Typeclass?

--

* typeclass comes from Haskell

--

* ad-hoc polymorphism

--

* a contract for a type similar to an interface

--

* lets see an example

--

```scala
// With interface

final case class Rational(p: Int, q: Int) extends Comparable[Rational] {
  def compareTo(o: Rational): Int = p * o.q - o.p * q
}

object Rational {

  // Equivalent typeclass
  implicit val rationalOrdering: Ordering[Rational] = new Ordering[Rational] {
    def compare(a: Rational, b: Rational): Int = a.p * b.q - b.p * a.q
  }
}
```

---

# Encoding in Scala

--

* Typeclasses are traits

--

* Methods on the trait usually take a first arguments of the instance type

--

* Instances for types are implicits

--

* Requiring an instance means taking an implicit parameter

--

```scala
class List[A] {
  // ...
  def sorted(implicit ev: Ordering[A]): List[A]
  // ...
}
```

???

Read this as Given an `Ordering[A]` I can produce a sorted `List[A]`

---

# Why Would We Want This?


--

* The simplest typeclass uses are easily encodable with interfaces

--

* `Ordering[A]` is more or less the same as `implements Comparable[A]`

--

* With the typeclass approach we can define operations that rely on typeclass at the point of consumption. 

--

* This allow for 'conditionally' defined methods

???

See the ordering example for sort above

--

* In Java, Collections just has a bunch of random methods

???
IMO this is easier to think about

---

# Built-In Typeclasses

--

* There are lots of useful built-ins in scala.math

--

* Numeric - operations on numbers: comparison, math operations, comparisons, etc.

--

* Fractional - adds div

--

* Integral - adds quot and rem

--

* Equiv

---

# Why Would We Want This - Semigroup?

--

* A Semigroup is something with an append/addition operation

--

* Numeric... but even more general

--

* Some common examples of semigroups: Int, Double, String, List

--

```scala
trait Semigroup[A] {
  def append(a1: A, a2: A): A
}
```

--

* A Monoid is a semigroup with the addition of an identity element.

???

Think `0` for Int, `""` for String

--

```scala
trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] {
  def empty: A
}
```

---

# Why Would We Want This - Derivable Instances

```scala
implicit val intMonoid: Monoid[Int] = new Monoid[Int] {
  def append(a1: Int, a2: Int): Int = a1 + a2
  def empty: Int = 0
}

implicit def optionMonoid[A: Semigroup]: Monoid[Option[A]] = 
  new Monoid[Option[A]] {
    def append(a1: Option[A], a2: Option[A]): Option[A] = 
      // a1 + a2
      a1.flatMap(a => a2.map(b => implicitly[Semigroup[A]].append(a, b)))
        // a2 is 0
        .orElse(a1)
        // a1 is 0
        .orElse(a2)
    def empty: Option[A] = None
  }
```

???
Stop to make sure everyone understands what this is doing?

---

# Why Would We Want This

--

* Automatic derivation; Instances based on typeclass instances of other types

--

* If we have a `Semigroup[A]` we automatically have a `Monoid[Option[A]]`

--

* We can use None as a standin for the 0

--

* This kind of dependent relationship is hard to express with interfaces 
  but is common with the decoupling provided by typeclasses

--

* `class Option[A] extends Monoid[Option[A]] when A <: Semigroup` ?!?!

???

Semigroups but not monoids (NEL, NEV)...

Map, combine at the overlap point, but not a great way of specifying the zero

---

# Why Would We Want This

--

* We can mix together typeclass constraints to build powerful abstractions

--

* Ever wanted to quickly sum the numbers in some collection

--

```scala
def sum[A: Monoid](as: List[A]): A = 
  as.foldLeft(implicitly[Monoid[A]].empty)(implicitly[Monoid[A]].append)
```
```scala
scala> sum(List(1, 2, 3))
res2: Int = 6
```
--

* Oh, the requirements changed, now we have to some records that may or may not have numbers and those should be treated as 0...

--

* We don't even have to change any code at the call site unless we provided type annotations for some reason

--

```scala
scala> sum(List(Some(1), Some(2), None, Some(3)))
res3: Option[Int] = Some(6)
```

---

# Typeclass Providers

--

* There are several projects/ecosystems that provide typeclasses

--

* [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) - the original; monolithic; in development version 8 is experimenting with a new encoding

--

* [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) - newer; ecosystem of projects roughly equivalent to scalaz

--

* [kittens](https://github.com/typelevel/kittens) - can derive a number of typeclasses for cats

--

* [spire](https://github.com/typelevel/spire) - also typelevel; types and typeclasses for numeric operations; provides things similar to Ordering and Numeric

--

* Most Scala json libraries use typeclasses to control encoding/decoding

???

* All of these provide Semigroup and Monoid before you roll your own

---

# Common Typeclass and Their Uses

* To access all of these implicits you can import the following.

```scala
import cats._
import cats.data._
import cats.implicits._
```

--

* Typeclasses are expected to have laws to which they conform. 

--

* These laws are what allow composition of arbitrary types to work and usually do something sensible (although not always useful)

---

# Eq

--

* Compare two objects for equality in a typesafe manner

--

* cats defines syntax that lets you use `===` (just like in JS) and won't compile unless both types are the same

--

* `Eq[T].eqv(t1, t2)` can also be used

--

* Equality for collection types can be derived if their elements can be compared for equality

--

* Bypasses the fact everything has a `.equals` by default which may not make sense 

--

* You don't have to worry about accidentally comparing futures for equality

---

# Show

--

* Convert an object into a string representation

--

* Provides syntax t.show to perform the conversion

--

* Provides an interpolator `show` like the builtin but only for objects with show instances

--

* Bypasses everything having a `.toString` by default which renders useless information

---

# Functor

--

 * things that have map

```scala
def add1[F[_]: Functor](fa: F[Int]): F[Int] = fa.map(_ + 1)
```

```scala
scala> add1(42.some)
res0: Option[Int] = Some(43)

scala> add1(List(42, 43, 44))
res1: List[Int] = List(43, 44, 45)

scala> add1(42.asRight[String])
res2: Either[String,Int] = Right(43)
```

???
Make sure to discuss syntax
Also, make sure to talk about how extremely general so much of this is

---
# Functor Laws

* Mapping with identity must be the same as applying identity

```scala
def id[F[_]: Functor, A](fa: F[A]): Unit = 
  assert(fa.map(identity) == identity(fa))
```

* Mapping with the composition of 2 functions is the same as mapping one then the other

```scala
def composition[F[_]: Functor, A, B, C](fa: F[A], f: A => B, g: B => C): Unit = 
  assert(fa.map(f.andThen(g)) == fa.map(f).map(g))
```

---

# Unusual Functors

* Functions!

```scala
scala> val strLen = (s: String) => s.length
strLen: String => Int = $$Lambda$5899/115481011@e517a6e

scala> val strLenX4 = strLen.fmap(_ * 4)
strLenX4: String => Int = scala.Function1$$Lambda$4333/1919257832@5183d941

scala> strLenX4("abc")
res3: Int = 12
```

* Parsers!

```scala
import io.circe._
import io.circe.parser.decode
```

```scala
scala> implicit val reverseString = Decoder[Int].map(_.toString.reverse)
reverseString: io.circe.Decoder[String] = io.circe.Decoder$$anon$21@7de08930

scala> decode[String]("24")(reverseString)
res4: Either[io.circe.Error,String] = Right(42)
```

???

What is the meaning of these fun tricks
Functions... the 'value' contained is the rsult of application
So mapping a f with g is the same as composing f with g

Parsers... you can always apply a function to the result of a parse if it was successful
Its like mapping of an either produced by the parse

The point isn't that functors are 'containers' but just that they have a polymorphic parameter

---

# Monad

* A miniature effectful program.

--

* All monads are functors with an added point/pure and flatMap function

--
* The flatMap means we can use it with for comprehensions
```scala
// Named M to not conflict with the actual monad from cats in scope
trait M {
  def point[F[_], A](a: A): F[A]
  def flatMap[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
}
```

---

# Common Examples

* Options are monads

--

* Lists are monads

--

* Futures are monads

```scala
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
def random: Future[Double] = Future { scala.util.Random.nextDouble }
```

--

* If you can use it in a `for { }` block it is probably a monad

--

* Some notable exceptions include:
  * Set - map doesn't compose correctly
  * String - doens't have a generic parameter

---

# Abstracting with Typeclasses

* We will compute the maximum of values

--

* The numeric typeclass which abstracts over number types will help us

--

* The precise meaning depends on the Monad itself

--

```scala
def maxM[M[_], N](ma: M[N], mb: M[N])
                 (implicit M: Monad[M], N: Numeric[N]): M[N] = 
  for {
    a <- ma
    b <- mb
  } yield N.max(a, b)
```

---

# Absraction in Action


```scala
scala> maxM[Option, Int](5.some, 7.some)
res6: Option[Int] = Some(7)

scala> maxM[Option, Int](5.some, none)
res7: Option[Int] = None

scala> // The maximum of each in the cross product of left and right
     | maxM[List, Byte](List(1, -7), List(-5, 9))
res9: List[Byte] = List(1, 9, -5, 9)

scala> Await.result(maxM[Future, Double](random, random), Duration.Inf)
res10: Double = 0.8236876786370431

scala> Await.result(maxM[Future, Double](random, random), Duration.Inf)
res11: Double = 0.07963618293454378

scala> Await.result(maxM[Future, Double](random, random), Duration.Inf)
res12: Double = 0.8365803328209139
```

---

# Traverse

--

* Related to Traversable from the scala stdlib

--

* A more powerful form of Functor

--

* Effects can also be flipped inside out during the mapping

--

* `F[G[A]] ~> G[F[A]]`

---

# Examples
```scala
import cats._, cats.implicits._

def randomWithMax(n: Int): Future[Int] = Future { scala.util.Random.nextInt(n) }
```

--

```scala
scala> Await.result(List(10, 30, 40, 50).traverse(randomWithMax), Duration.Inf)
res13: List[Int] = List(7, 18, 5, 32)

scala> Await.result(List(10, 30, 40, 50).traverse(randomWithMax), Duration.Inf)
res14: List[Int] = List(5, 9, 17, 43)
```

```scala
scala> Await.result(10.some.traverse(randomWithMax), Duration.Inf)
res15: Option[Int] = Some(2)

scala> Await.result(10.some.traverse(randomWithMax), Duration.Inf)
res16: Option[Int] = Some(0)

scala> Await.result(none[Int].traverse(randomWithMax), Duration.Inf)
res17: Option[Int] = None
```

???
I'm using Future as an 'effect container' here. I would generally use something like IO, ZIO

Discuss that we are flipping the M inside out and then dereferencing which strips away the outer Future
Note that I am using the cats helpers

---

# Why Is This Useful?

--

* Being able to switch betweeen 'container types' is cute, but seldom useful in practice (in ~10 years, I've found it useful once)

--

* Writing polymorphic code means that you know less about the types that are involved. 

--

* The less you know about the types, the fewer ways there are to write an implementation

--

* The fewer ways there are to write an implementation the harder it is to get it wrong

---

# Lets See an Example

```scala
import cats._
import cats.data._
import cats.implicits._

def max[F[_]: Reducible, A: Order](fa: F[A]): A = 
  Reducible[F].reduceLeft(fa)((x, y) => if (Order[A].gt(x, y)) x else y)
```

---

# Compared To

```
def max(list: List[Int]): Int = 
  list.sort.head

```

--

* head is not the max of a sorted list

--

* crashes on empty list

---

# Why Is This Useful - Pt. 2

--

* Typeclasses (and especially those from cats, scalaz, spire...) express well studied abstractions and compose in well defined ways

--

* Using them can save on tremendous amounts of code
